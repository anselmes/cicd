## Quick Start

### Using as a Template
1. Clone this repository
2. Customize the workflows in [`.github/workflows/`](.github/workflows/) for your needs
3. Update configuration files as needed

### Using Reusable Workflows
Reference the workflows in your repository:

```yaml
name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  review:
    uses: anselmes/cicd/.github/workflows/review.yml@main
    
  security:
    uses: anselmes/cicd/.github/workflows/trivy.yml@main
    permissions:
      contents: read
      security-events: write
```

### Using Composite Actions
Reference the actions in your workflow:

```yaml
- name: Build Container
  uses: anselmes/cicd/.github/actions/docker@main
  with:
    tag: my-app
    publish: true
```

## Configuration

### Environment Setup
- Copy [`.devcontainer/`](.devcontainer/) to your project for consistent development environments
- Use [`scripts/configure.sh`](scripts/configure.sh) to set up your development environment
- Customize [`scripts/environment.sh`](scripts/environment.sh) and [`scripts/aliases.sh`](scripts/aliases.sh) as needed

### Security Configuration
- Set up required secrets in your repository settings
- Configure branch protection rules
- Enable security features like Dependency Graph and Secret Scanning

### Code Quality Tools
- Copy relevant configuration files (`.yamllint.yaml`, `.hadolint.yaml`, etc.)
- Customize [`.trunk/trunk.yaml`](.trunk/trunk.yaml) for your project's needs
- Set up [`.pre-commit-config.yaml`](.pre-commit-config.yaml) for pre-commit hooks

## Scripts

- [`configure.sh`](scripts/configure.sh) - Development environment setup
- [`configure-gh-actions-runner.sh`](scripts/configure-gh-actions-runner.sh) - Self-hosted runner setup
- [`delete-gh-actions-cache.sh`](scripts/delete-gh-actions-cache.sh) - GitHub Actions cache cleanup
- [`environment.sh`](scripts/environment.sh) - Environment variables configuration
- [`aliases.sh`](scripts/aliases.sh) - Shell aliases setup
